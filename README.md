# 🐟 Fish — The AI Game

Fish — The AI Game is a Python-based artificial intelligence project that simulates intelligent fish behavior in a game environment. The project is designed to demonstrate AI logic, iterative improvements, and user interface enhancements through multiple versions of the same game.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This repository follows an incremental development model:
- One **main, stable implementation**
- Multiple **improved and experimental versions**
- UI-based enhancements for better interaction

The goal is to explore how AI behavior evolves through code refinement and experimentation.

---

## 🧠 Main Code

### `Fish_game.py`
- This is the **primary and final version** of the game
- Contains the **core game loop**, **AI decision-making logic**, and **main mechanics**
- All other files are improvements or experiments based on this implementation

👉 **Run this file to experience the complete game**

## 🔧 Improvement & Experimental Files

| File Name        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `fish.py`        | Basic prototype of fish behavior |
| `fish1.py`       | Improved AI logic and decision flow |
| `fish2.py`       | Optimized or alternate AI strategies |
| `fish_ui.py`     | Game logic with a basic user interface |
| `fish_ui_1.py`   | Enhanced UI with improved interaction |

These files represent learning stages and optimization attempts.
